# AtmoSync 🌤️

**AtmoSync** is a simple and intuitive Java-based weather application that fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API. Designed with a user-friendly interface built in Java Swing, AtmoSync allows users to quickly check the current weather conditions for any city around the world.

## Features:
- 🌍 Search weather by city name
- 🌡️ Display real-time temperature (converted from Kelvin to Celsius)
- ☁️ Show current weather description (e.g., sunny, cloudy, etc.)
- 💧 Display humidity levels
- 📡 Uses OpenWeatherMap API for up-to-date weather data

## Tech Stack:
- **Java (Swing GUI)**: For the user interface and core functionality
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: For fetching real-time weather information
- **HTTP Requests**: Java's `HttpURLConnection` for API interaction

## How It Works:
1. Enter the name of any city in the input field.
2. Click the "Get Weather" button.
3. View the current weather details for the city, including temperature, weather conditions, and humidity.

## Purpose:
This project was developed as a finals assignment for the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course at the University of Science and Technology of Southern Philippines (USTP) - Cagayan de Oro.
